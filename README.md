RHCE (Red Hat Certified Engineer) certification is a technical certification that verifies the skills and knowledge of IT professionals in deploying, configuring, managing, and troubleshooting Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems.

The RHCE certification is offered by Red Hat, a leading provider of open source solutions. To earn the RHCE certification, candidates must pass a hands-on, performance-based exam that tests their ability to perform real-world tasks in a simulated environment. The exam covers topics such as system configuration and management, network services, security, and troubleshooting.

The RHCE certification is widely recognized in the IT industry and is considered a valuable credential for IT professionals working with RHEL systems. It is also a prerequisite for some advanced Red Hat certifications, such as the Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA) certification.
